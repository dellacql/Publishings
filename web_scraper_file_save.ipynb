These horses, however, about which you ask me, are freshly come from Thrace. Diomed killed their king with the twelve bravest of his companions. Hard by the ships we took a thirteenth man- a scout whom Hector and the other Trojans had sent as a spy upon our ships.\n",

      "He laughed as he spoke and drove the horses over the ditch, while the other Achaeans followed him gladly. When they reached the strongly built quarters of the son of Tydeus, they tied the horses with thongs of leather to the manger, where the steeds of Diomed stood eating their sweet corn, but Ulysses hung the blood-stained spoils of Dolon at the stern of his ship, that they might prepare a sacred offering to Minerva. As for themselves, they went into the sea and washed the sweat from their bodies, and from their necks and thighs. When the sea-water had taken all the sweat from off them, and had refreshed them, they went into the baths and washed themselves. After they had so done and had anointed themselves with oil, they sat down to table, and drawing from a full mixing-bowl, made a drink-offering of wine to Minerva.\n",

      "Here is a summary of the passage from Book 9 of Homer's Iliad:\n",
      "\n",
      "The scene shifts to Patroclus, who has been persuaded by Achilles' friend Nestor to talk to Achilles. Patroclus sets off to find Achilles and tells him about the message he received from Nestor. He explains that the Achaeans are in a difficult position and that they need someone with Achilles' skills to help them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Patroclus meets Eurypylus, who is wounded by an arrow and is being led away by Menoetius. Patroclus expresses his concern for Eurypylus' safety and asks him if he thinks the Achaeans will be able to defeat Hector. Eurypylus replies that the situation is hopeless and that the Achaeans are doomed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Patroclus then decides to take action, saying that he will go to Achilles and try to convince him to help the Achaeans. He also tells Menoetius about the conversation with Eurypylus and offers to return with him if Achilles agrees to let him accompany him into battle.\n",
      "\n",
      "The passage ends with Patroclus heading off to find Achilles, determined to persuade him to help the Achaeans.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's worth noting that this book is an important one in the Iliad, as it marks a turning point in the war and sets the stage for the events of the final books. The story of Patroclus' mission to convince Achilles to fight again has become iconic in Western literature and continues to be referenced and reinterpreted today.\n",

      "The tenth year had passed, but no one could foretell what would happen next; the fate of Troy was like a burning fire that was consuming it from within. The gods were angry with each other over the death of Patroclus, for they knew not who among them was responsible for his cruel fate.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the city was still reeling from this disaster, I came up to the great hall where the princes were gathered. They looked at me with a mixture of curiosity and suspicion, but I told them all that had happened, just as my father had bidden me.\n",

      "As I looked around, I saw that my friends were all gathered in the same place they had been the day before: outside my house, where we had planned to hold a funeral for Patroclus. The princes were divided into two groups, each with their own leaders and counselors.\n",
      "\n",
      "The group of elders decided to send a delegation to the Achaeans to ask them to leave us alone and not continue attacking our city.

      "**Hector Takes Control**\n",
      "\n",
      "Hector, inspired by Zeus, takes control of the Trojan army and leads a charge towards the Greek ships.

      "**Ajax's Courage**\n",
      "\n",

      "**The Greek Line is Breached**\n",

      "Now Patroclus, son of Menoetius, the greatest glory had been attained by him, for he had slain many of the Trojans. But when his strength began to wane, and his shield was torn from his shoulders, and the spear which had been broken in his hand fell to the ground, he cried out:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, cruel fate! Oh, woe is me!\n",
      "For I have come to a place where there is no life.\n",
      "I see my own death before me,\n",
      "And that of Hector, too, who was my foe.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But Euphorbus son of Panthous, the best spearman of his time, as also the finest horseman and fleetest runner, came behind him and struck him in the back with a spear, midway between the shoulders. This man as soon as ever he had come up with his chariot had dismounted twenty men, so proficient was he in all the arts of war.\n",
      "\n",
      "Euphorbus then ran back into the crowd, after drawing his ashen spear out of the wound; he would not stand firm and wait for Patroclus, unarmed though he now was, to attack him; but Patroclus unnerved, alike by the blow the god had given him and by the spear-wound, drew back under cover of his men in fear for his life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hector on this, seeing him to be wounded and giving ground, forced his way through the ranks, and when close up with him struck him in the lower part of the belly with a spear, driving the bronze point right through it, so that he fell heavily to the ground to the great of the Achaeans.\n",
      "\n",
      "As when a lion has fought some fierce wild-boar and worsted him—the two fight furiously upon the mountains over some little fountain at which they would both drink, and the lion has beaten the boar till he can hardly breathe—so did Hector son of Priam take the life of the brave son of Menoetius who had killed so many, striking him from close at hand, and vaunting over him the while.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Patroclus,\" said he, \"you deemed that you should sack our city, rob our Trojan women of their freedom, and carry them off in your ships to your own country. Fool; Hector and his fleet horses were ever straining their utmost to defend them. I am foremost of all the Trojan warriors to stave the day of bondage from off them; as for you, vultures shall devour you here. Poor wretch, Achilles with all his bravery availed you nothing; and yet I ween when you left him he charged you straightly saying, 'Come not back to the ships, knight Patroclus, till you have rent the bloodstained shirt of murderous Hector about his body. Thus I ween did he charge you, and your fool's heart answered him 'yea' within you.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, as the life ebbed out of you, you answered, O knight Patroclus: \"Hector, vaunt as you will, for Jove the son of Saturn and Apollo have vouchsafed you victory; it is they who have vanquished me so easily, and they who have stripped the armour from my shoulders; had twenty such men as you attacked me, all of them would have fallen before my spear. Fate and the son of Leto have overpowered me, and among mortal men Euphorbus; you are yourself third only in the killing of me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I say further, and lay my saying to your heart, you too shall live but for a little season; death and the day of your doom are close upon you, and they will lay you low by the hand of Achilles son of Aeacus.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When he had thus spoken his eyes were closed in death, his soul left his body and flitted down to the house of Hades, mourning its sad fate and bidding farewell to the youth and vigor of its manhood. Dead though he was, Hector still spoke to him saying, \"Patroclus, why should you thus foretell my doom? Who knows but Achilles, son of lovely Thetis, may be smitten by my spear and die before me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As he spoke he drew the bronze spear from the wound, planting his foot upon the body, which he thrust off and let lie on its back. He then went spear in hand after Automedon, squire of the fleet descendant of Aeacus, for he longed to lay him low, but the immortal steeds which the gods had given as a rich gift to Peleus bore him swiftly from the field.\n",

The passage is written in a style that is characteristic of ancient Greek poetry, with a focus on the emotions and reactions of the characters involved.\n",
